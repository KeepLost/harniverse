/**
 * Construction of the pi-ai `Provider` that one configured route registers into
 * the adapter's `Models` collection.
 *
 * Two constructions, one decision: a route the installed catalog ships, whose
 * models all keep the protocols their catalog entries speak, **reuses that
 * catalog provider** with its models replaced — the catalog provider owns API
 * implementations this package cannot reconstruct (Bedrock loads its Smithy
 * module through a separate entry point), so rebuilding it from parts would
 * silently narrow which providers work. Every other route — one pi-ai has
 * never heard of, a model an entry repointed through its own `api`, or a
 * route-level protocol override — is served per model through the protocol
 * table below, which lets one route mix protocols without splitting into two
 * user-visible providers.
 *
 * Credentials never reach this module's storage: the harness resolves a route's
 * key through `ctx.credentials` before the request enters pi-ai and hands it
 * over as a stream option, which `Models` presents to `resolve()` as the
 * credential key.
